=====

- Fixed request parameters being ignored on Kodi 18 (Leia)


0.3
===

- Allow ints to be passed to plugin.url_for() and str() them.
- plugin.set_resolved_url() now takes an item dict instead of a URL. (The URL
  is still allowed for backwards compatibility but is decprecated).
- Ability to replace the context menu items by setting 'replace_context_menu'
  to True in an item dict.
- pluign.get_setting() now requires an extra paramter, *converter*, which
  converts the item from XML to a python type specified by converter.
- Major bug fix to accomodate handles > 0 in XBMC Frodo.
- Auto-call plugin.finish(succeeded=False) if a view returns None.
- XBMC now decides the default player when using plugin.play_video().
- Storages now call sync() when clear() is called.
- Added plugin.clear_function_cache() which clears the storage behind the
  @cached and @cached_route decorators.
- Add ability to set stream info for list items. Also, devs can now add
  stream_info to item dicts.
- Added the actions module. Contains actions.background() and
  actions.update_view() which are convenience wrappers for RunPlugin() and
  Container.Update().
- Allow passing of functions to url_for.
- 'properties' key in an item dict should now be a dictionary. A list of tuples
  is still allowed for backwards compatibility.
- Addon user is now prompted and storage automatically cleared if it becomes
  corrupted.
- Added subtitles support. A 'subtitles' parameter was added to
  plugin.set_resolved_url().
- xbmcswift2 URLs and routing code is now indifferent to a trailing slash.
- Bug fixes. See https://github.com/jbeluch/xbmcswift2/issues?milestone=3.
